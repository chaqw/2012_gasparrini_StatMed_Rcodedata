### Updated R code and data from Gasparrini StatMed 2012

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An application of multivariate meta-analysis for pooling estimates of non-linear associations from multiple studies. The code included is applicable beyond the specific setting of time series analysis of temperature-health relationships. The example illustrate the analysis in the article:

Gasparrini A, Armstrong B, Kenward MG. Multivariate meta-analysis for non-linear and other multi-parameter associations. *Statistics in Medicine*. 2012;**31**(29):3821-39. [[freely available here](http://www.ag-myresearch.com/2012_gasparrini_statmed.html)]

Note that the example is different than that included in the paper, as the original data are not available any more. The code primarily uses functions in the R package mvmeta, but functions in the R package dlnm are applied as well.

The material:

  * *data.RData* stores the dataset used to perform an illustrative example in an R data format
  * the numbered files from *01.mkdata.R* to *06.addresults.R*, to be run sequentially, reproduce the example (different from that in the article)
